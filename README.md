# Musicalli

An elegant React.js Music Application.
[Check it out](https://musicalli.netlify.app/)

This project was built using React.js, Redux, Shazam Core API, Tailwind CSS, and more. It's been a while since I made my last website, so I decided to get back on track with one of the projects I've always wanted to do. Along the way, I learned more about APIs and how to integrate them into web applications.

With Musicalli, you can listen to your favorite songs, search for all artists and songs, discover the top hits internationally, generally, and in your country specifically, and view the lyrics for each song. Additionally, you can find songs with the same vibe by clicking on the song's name and doing the same for each artist. There are songs in nearly every language!

My favorite thing about Musicalli is the "Related Songs" feature on the website because it introduces me to different songs that have a similar energy to the one I'm currently playing. Feel free to share what you liked the most as well :)
